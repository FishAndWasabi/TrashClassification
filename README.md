# TrashClassification
The package is designed for classifying trash. The main capabilities include collecting images of individual pieces of trash from cameras on the mechanisms, and dividing the trash into two categories: recyclable and organic. From the technical perspective, the first capability mainly uses OpenCV to implement while the other depends on deep learning which is a subclass of machine learning to construct the binary classification model.
